        <h1>Case Philosophy</h1>
        <p>Solving problems using data is extremely useful, exciting, and sometimes challenging. Below, you will find a summary 
            of my thoughts on the subject. It might get a bit technical at times, but hopefully, you will have a brief overview 
            after reading it.</p>
        <h2>What answers do we need?</h2>
        <p>The first step in any analysis is to clarify the needs and ultimate purpose of the research question. What do we actually 
            want to get out of this? For example, maybe we want to find out what kind of web design solution generates the highest 
            user satisfaction. Or perhaps we are interested in predicting what movie someone would like or maybe if a message should 
            be dumped into the spam folder. In the first case, we are in the statistical realm of causality, and in the second, we 
            need to use machine learning algorithms to make predictions.</p>
        <h2>What data do we have?</h2>
        <p>Secondly, in any data-driven analysis, one must consider the available data. There are indeed quite some pitfalls here. 
            If our data isn't generated from a randomized experiment, we must take all possible measures to mitigate bias problems. 
            Or, if we don't have that much data, we should avoid building a too large model. Furthermore, if we need to perform the 
            analysis before observing all the final outcomes, perhaps we should choose a survival analysis methodology. In short, 
            the data you have access to might make you adjust your analysis so that it can answer your needs in the best way possible.</p>
