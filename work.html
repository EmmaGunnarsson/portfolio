                <p><strong>Master Thesis (Uppsala University)</strong></p>
                <p>In my master thesis, I wrote about how election cycles affect microfinance institutions in India, using state level data and a dynamic regresson design.
                    I did find some indications that the microfinance sector in India is negatively effected in state election years. The data analysis was performed in Stata. You can find the paper here;</p>

                <p><strong>Bachelor Thesis (Uppsala University)</strong></p>
                <p>My bachelor thesis in Statistics was purely theoretical. It discusses the issue of so called post hoc power in statistical hypothesis testing. 
                    In some research fields, such as phsychology and medicine, a large enough sample might be hard to obtain, making sufficient power an issue. 
                    In these cases, some researchers whitewashes their null results with the low power, claiming that a larger sample would have produced some significant results.
                    In order to show how large sample they would have needed, they use the estimated effect to compute the post hoc power for various sample sizes.
                    In this paper, I show why this is nonsensical, and actually violates the whole idea of frequentist hypothesis testing. 
                    I do this by showing the logic of power calculations, as well as by Monte Carlo simulations. The figures and simulations were made in R. You can find the paper here;</p>
